# Window Managers
I don't know about you, but I really like tiling window managers. 

## Subtle
Place the subtle.rb file in $HOME/.config/subtle/. To check if the syntax will work with your build of subtle, please run the command "subtle -k". 

*Icons* are from [here](http://subforge.org/attachments/download/43/icons.xz). You need to rename the file to "icons.tar.xz" because the uploader forgot to include the "tar" part. Otherwise, you will not be able to download it.
