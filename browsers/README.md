# Browsers
In these folders, I've included configuration files for the following browsers:
* Firefox
* Jumanji
* Luakit

## Firefox
Recommended Extensions:
 * [Pentadactyl Nightly](http://dactyl.sourceforge.net/nightlies)
 * [Stylish](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/)
 * [GreaseMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)

### Notes
The file /pentadactylrc/ should be placed in your home folder and renamed to .pentadactylrc.

The files under Stylish merely need to be copied and pasted into stylish's manager.
